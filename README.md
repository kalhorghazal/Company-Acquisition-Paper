# Directories

Our analysis scripts are classified into the following folders:

* **Structural Analysis**: This folder contains the Python scripts we used to calculate different structural features, such as density, transitivity, and average clustering coefficient for the networks.

* **Assortativity Analysis**: This folder contains the Python scripts we used to calculate assortativity coefficients for different nodal attributes, such as country, city, and category on the networks.

* **ERGM Analysis**:  This folder contains the R scripts we used to fit the ERGM models for the networks, calculating their estimates for different nodal attributes.

* **Temporal Analysis**: This folder contains the Python scripts we used to investigate the evolution of the acquisition network over time by calculating different structural features at different time slots.

* **Centrality Analysis**: This folder contains the Python script we employed to calculate centrality measures on the cross-city acquisition network.
